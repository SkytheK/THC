## Terrible Hackiemos Crackt00l
This is the official github repository for the THC, a pentesting tool created by Eur1p3des and Rsae.
### What is this tool?
THC is a cracking station which allows its users to find vulnerabilities inside a system in order to make that device safer by knowing its weaknesses.\
Under no circumstance it is designed to make a profit.

### How can you access the tool?
Once the tool is connected to a device via USB, a Virtual Net, will be created. Once this Net is running, you can either user your computer or mobile phone to connect via Wifi.\
When you are connected to the wifi, you will not have internet access, but if you search on the web browser the following address: ```https://172.0.24.1```, you will access the web interface of the THC cracktool.
